In my near-decade of being a technology professional in the DC area I've learned and observed various ways of supporting the Federal Government. There's ways to support by handling administration, engineering, or implementation tasks. There's more, though each are specialists in their own domains, and they'll execute the orders carried out and set by the management above them. 

Over time, I've also witnessed the process improvement consultants having an important role. These consultants will stay on top of industry standards to provide education and training to Federal staff. Some are very good and it will show when the organization begins to succeed in human factors, and others are not very good and the organization will accept the financial loss after so many months or years. The organization will identify a need to improve its processes, make the need public and begin the proposal and awarding process. There's good people that are willing to help educate and train, and there's people that are good at convincing. It's a vicious cycle.

## Identifying Pain
A lot of Government people have experienced trauma with their jobs in one way or another. Some more times than they'll admit. 


## Serial Entre

serial entrepreneur

The new trend of technology professionals, which I've noticed, have come into their own with supporting the Federal Government. These professionals are leaders in innovation. The forward-thinking, the successful backgrounds, and the public appearances making them attractive and they're being offered roles of high-level civil servants, such as special advisor or CXO. Because of this new shininess it's becoming difficult to avoid being short-sighted and overlooking _being innovative_ versus _promoting innovation_ and falling into the trap

They're not necessarily rookies, but they're also not heroes.

## structure
* intro
* organizational trauma from failed implementations and bad consultants
* technology falling behind
* enter serial entrepreneur (give example of real entrepreneur)
* this is something that doesn't work in the federal government
  * getting CXO
  * setting themselves up for cushy private sector job
* conclusion
* One day someone will remember that we actually need to engineer something.
* I fear that they may have just hit the 'move fast and break things' era that industry is finally realizing was a horrible idea.
